# datascience_fifa23
Using Pandas and a Fifa 2023 dataset from Kaggle. Objective with this little project was to import data and clean it up to isolate exactly what we needed. I was looking for potentially undervalued football players based on their market value and wage for 2023. Seaborn and Bokeh used to create a scatter plot graph with hover functionality.

Project was created using Jupyter Notebook, to access the hover functionality please download the files and run within your own Jupyter Notebook.
